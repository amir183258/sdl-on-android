# dex

This folder contains the final **DEX file** (`classes.dex`) of the Android application.

The DEX file represents the **entry point of the Android app** and is responsible for loading and interacting with the native `.so` libraries built from the C/C++ sources.

This file must be consistent with the declarations in `AndroidManifest.xml` (application class, activity name, package name, etc.) in order for the application to launch correctly.
