# SDL on Android

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)** on the **Android operating system**.  

Typically, developers use build tools like **Gradle** or **CMake** to integrate SDL into Android projects.  
In this repository, however, the entire process is performed **manually**, which was an extremely educational experience for me.

The `build_libs.sh` script outlines all the steps required to build the project.  
It is highly recommended to review **all the files in this repository** to fully understand how the system works and how you can adapt it to your own projects.

In the sections below, I will walk you through the process step by step.
